## Explanation
In this repository I used WHO's(World Health Organization) dataset about covid19 to plot Iran's data using R and openair library.
First of all I saw that WHO's data have some problems in Iran so that before starting to plot the data I decided to fix the dataset.
After fixing it I used [openair](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openair) library to plot data in calendar using calendarPlot function.
